***High school senior Eddie and his girlfriend Alicia head to an abandoned logging trail for a little bit of alone time. They soon find that they’re not alone. The trail ends behind the very secretive Tamerlane Research Facility, and one of their experiments has gotten loose. Tragedy ensues and it’s up to Alicia and Eddie’s older brother to get to the bottom of what happened, but that’s easier said than done when a very powerful, immoral figure doesn’t want the details of the tragedy to be uncovered.***

I recently joined a group on Goodreads and **The Lupin Project** was one of the group reads for December. I’m glad it was because this was a thrill ride of a book!

My dad is an avid Dean Koontz fan, and as a result I’m partial to a bit of Koontz myself, so this genre mash-up of thriller, experiment-gone-wrong, with a dash of horror was a highly entertaining read for me.

Although I would have liked a bit more horror via the wolves, I feel like the suspense and pacing of this book was fantastic, it definitely had me turning the pages. The biggest strength of this book for me was the perfect beginning; two teenagers driving to the woods for a little bit of privacy- when will these kids learn? Although as a horror fan I knew this date wasn’t going to end well for Eddie and Alicia, it didn’t make it any less impactful. I loved the gore scenes, and was even left feeling a little bit heartbroken.

I’d recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of suspenseful experiment-gone-wrong/ corrupt government cover-up stories. I thought this was a great read and I really enjoyed Allan Leverone’s writing style. I’m glad to have found another awesome author to explore further.
