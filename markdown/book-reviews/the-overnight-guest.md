description: "My 3.5-star review of “The Overnight Guest” by Heather Gudenkauf"

---

***Desperate to focus on writing her book and escape her rocky relationship with her teenaged son and ex-husband, true crime writer Wylie Lark retreats to an old, unoccupied small town farmhouse. It was at this farmhouse twenty years ago that a gruesome double murder took place and an abducted teenaged girl is still missing to this day. Alone and isolated with a fierce snowstorm keeping her inside, Wylie should finish this book in no time, but she isn’t alone. Discovering a small child  on the brink of death out in the snow, the search for answers begins. Where were the parents and how did the child get out there alone in the middle of a vicious snowstorm?***

This was a tense, atmospheric crime thriller, and despite taking a few chapters to grip my attention, it was an exciting read overall. As with most things, there were things I loved and things I didn’t, so I’ll get the things I didn’t out of the way first. 

To elaborate on it taking a few chapters to grip me, the book is told through three timelines; present day, twenty years ago, and one that is unknown in the beginning. Three timelines with multiple characters took me a while to get used to, I actually made a note of the timelines and characters in a notebook as I read. The other gripe I had with this book is that the inclusion of the unknown timeline made the mysteries a bit less mysterious. I was able to make some conclusions quite early on. 

Now for the positives, of which there are more. Despite the first few chapters being a bit difficult to follow, by chapter five I was invested. The key players in the past timeline were becoming obvious now and Heather Gudenkauf is fantastic at characterisation, particularly when it comes to imperfect characters. I love a grey character and including our protagonist, Wylie, I can’t say I would want to be friends with any of them. To be clear, this is a positive for me. It’s realistic. The protagonist doesn’t always have to be a perfect hero or heroine when they are human.

My favourite thing about the book is that it was genuinely dark and harrowing. We, the readers, witness some really horrific human behaviour and the scenes of gore and violence were beautifully and vividly written. This definitely isn’t for anyone without a strong stomach. Luckily that isn’t me, but even I grimaced at times. 

The last thing I want to praise is the two known timelines (present day and tenty years ago) have different pacing and atmospheres. I’ve seen other readers say that they weren’t fans of this, but I personally loved it. I really enjoy both slow, atmospheric plots and fast-paced, thrilling plots, and I got both of these in one book. The past timeline was more of a slow burn with events unravelling bit by bit, whilst the present day timeline had that nail-biting race for answers while danger looms feeling. This contradiction of pace and atmosphere made The Overnight Guest really fun for me to read. 

Despite working out most of the mysteries early on, I was still excited to see how they all unravelled. If you love gritty, heartbreaking crime thrillers with plenty of secrets and imperfect characters (and downright detestable characters) this book is for you.
