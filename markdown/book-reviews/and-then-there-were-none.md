description: "My 5-star review of “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie"

---

*****A group of ten strangers is invited by a rich host, not known by any of them, to spend the weekend on a secluded private island on the English coast. The group is made up of ten very different people with various backgrounds and occupations, but they all share one thing in common- each of them has had a hand in the death of someone and gotten away with it. Upon their arrival they learn that their mysterious host has been held up and will be with them shortly, then they start to die one by one, and it quickly becomes clear that the killer is one of them.*****

I was very close to not writing this review. I thought, like I’m sure many people who like to review books think, “there’s no point in reviewing an old book.” But then I remembered that books have no expiry date and I’m typing up my thoughts for my own pleasure anyway (if someone should then become interested in a book after reading my review, I consider that a bonus), so here it is. I finally read *And Then There Were None*, considered by many to be Agatha Christie’s magnum opus, and it was glorious. 

It’s not hard to see why Agatha Christie earned the title “the Queen of Crime” or why *And Then There Were None* is considered a masterpiece and a classic. Going back to my point about books not having an expiry date, I’ve read a few books by other crime and mystery authors that followed *And Then There Were None* which very obviously took inspiration from it. I loved them, so I was excited to read it for myself. From shortly after its publication to today, Christie’s classic mystery has had and continues to have a profound impact on crime and mystery fiction and it’s writers. 

Initially I was worried that trying to keep track of ten characters would confuse me, but Christie managed to drop just enough backstory and characterisation about them all to make them unique and memorable. She expertly gave a glimpse into each character without diving in too deeply, allowing for time to build suspense, mystery and then eventually a very satisfying conclusion. 

Perhaps what I liked most about *And Then There Were None* was how dark it got in parts of the story. Agatha Christie is well-know for writing cosy murder mysteries with quirky characters, but this was not the case here. As we start to learn about the past deeds of each individual and we begin to see them having to face up to these deeds, realising that they can’t escape them, it gets a bit harrowing. We get a sense of their anxiety, paranoia and fear and this makes for very thrilling, and in some ways terrifying, reading. 

*And Then There Were None* is a perfectly paced bleak, claustrophobic, paranoia-inducing murder mystery with a constant sense of imminent doom. It’s immensely entertaining and deserving of it’s status as a masterpiece. This is actually my first Agatha Christie book, despite growing up in Britain and spending a lot of time with my nan watching Poirot and Miss Marple on TV. I have no doubt this was a great starting point for her work because I’m eager to read more.
