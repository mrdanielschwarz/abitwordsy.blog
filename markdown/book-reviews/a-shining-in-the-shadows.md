***Following the events of [The Making of Gabriel Davenport](https://abitwordsy.blog/book-reviews/making-of-gabriel-davenport/), remade, Gabriel is propelled into a new nightmare. His kind are being hunted and when his maker is abducted, he must untangle the web of clues to the mysterious “labyrinth” with his new family to find the only being that can stop those that threaten them.***

When I was at secondary school and college, vampires had a big surge in popularity because of a certain book series with shimmering vampires. One of my best friends would read every ‘paranormal romance’ book she could get her hands on and I just didn’t get it. I knew that vampire fiction could be excellent because I’d read *Dracula* and Anne Rice’s *Interview with the Vampire* is my favourite book of all time, but they’re Gothic horror books, not paranormal romance. Beverley Lee’s **Gabriel Davenport** series has an abundance of Gothic horror and I honestly haven’t enjoyed a vampire series this much since Anne Rice’s **Vampire Chronicles**. 

I adored *‘The Making of Gabriel Davenport’* (book 1 of the Gabriel Davenport series) and I think I loved this second instalment even more. It had everything I could ever ask for in a vampire story and more. Bloodthirsty vampires, Gothic settings, a mystery, and a romance I never new I needed, but definitely did!

This book continued immediately where book one left off, so it was easy to get right into the story, and I was so happy that the short chapters and multiple points of view were used again. I especially loved the multiple POV when it came to the romantic plot because we were able to see the inner thoughts of the characters in comparison to the way they interacted with each other when they were together. I liked the feeling of knowing more than the characters themselves and it made me root for them even more. 

The mystery at the centre really engrossed me, as did the mythology and lore, and I loved that it was all very unique and not like anything I’ve read before. 

The absolute strengths of the book, in my opinion, are the characters and Gothic imagery. I cannot tell you enough how much I adore Beverley Lee’s style of writing. It’s moody, poetic and romantic all at the same time and the atmosphere and setting that she creates are what my Gothic dreams are made of. Her characters are also excellently written. I care about every one of them, which for me, is rare in a book with quite a few characters. I’m even interested in the characters that you’re not really supposed to like. 

Once again, Beverley Lee has created the perfect vampire story with all of the horror, romance, Gothic imagery and mystery that I love so much and I can’t wait to read the 3rd and final book, despite the fact I’m sad it’s coming to an end. Thankfully books don’t expire, so I can re-read whenever I want to!
