***On Christmas, in the middle of one of the worst snowstorms Indiana has seen, a group of 5 strangers are left with no choice but to find shelter inside a roadside diner. As the storm worsens with no end in sight, the worst is still yet to come with a sixth visitor on their way to the diner, and they’re not bringing festive cheer.***

This Christmas-themed horror novella was such an entertaining little read. It was exactly what I needed to get me in the mood for the holidays. It was action-packed, full of wintery imagery, and it had me on the edge of my seat all the way through. It was also refreshing to read, because I feel like aliens are few and far between when it comes to horror.

The thing that amazed me about this book, and this is obviously a clear strength of the author, is that I became attached to the characters in such a short amount of time. He created such vivid, relatable characters that you really root for (for the most part). I wasn’t expecting this, so it was a welcome surprise.

Sergio Gomez is great at descriptive writing. The setting was so fantastically written that I really got the cold, wintery vibe of the scene. I could almost feel the bitter, icy wind stinging my cheeks! The gore scenes were also excellently written. They had me wincing with an impressive picture of the bloody mess and sounds that accompanied all the gore.

After reading **The Visitor**, I’m dreaming of a red Christmas and I’m excited to read some more of Sergio Gomez’s work in the coming year. I’m glad to be able to add another indie author to my growing list. It was a perfectly paced, action packed, nail-biting read, and it hit the festive spot perfectly.
