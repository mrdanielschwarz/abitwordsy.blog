description: "My 5-star review of “The Purity of Crimson” by Beverley Lee"

---

***Still being hunted, Gabriel and his brothers find shelter underneath the streets of London, but it’s not long before they’re joined by a mysterious witch boy and a fellow vampire-in-need. One is not who they claim to be, and when this inevitably leads to the separation of the brothers, they must fight their own battles. How will they fare without each other, the brothers they’ve relied on for protection and preservation, and what lengths will each of them go to to save each other?***

I was confident that this would be a five-star read following the first and second books in the series, and I was right to assume so. The third and final instalment of Beverley Lee’s *Gabriel Davenport* series was the perfect ending to a beautiful trilogy. 

As with the other books, there is no beating around the bush. The Purity of Crimson follows on directly from [A Shining in The Shadows](https://abitwordsy.blog/book-reviews/a-shining-in-the-shadows/), so we’re immediately transported back to this beautifully Gothic world that Beverley Lee has created, and all of its dangers. 

With most books, I’m intimidated when there are a large number of characters that I have to keep track of, but Beverley Lee is an expert at characterisation. Despite the introduction of several new characters, I was never confused or overwhelmed, and every character had just enough depth for me to either care about them or despise them. 

Although this book was a little bit more gritty than the previous two, swapping lush country landscape for the seedy underbelly of London, Beverley Lee’s descriptive writing was just as breathtaking. I can’t tell you enough how beautiful her prose has been throughout the entire series of books. I’ve been consistently mesmerised by the writing. 

The *Gabriel Davenport* trilogy is one of the best series of books I’ve read. It’s rare for every book in a series to be just as great as the previous one. I feel bittersweet about this book because it’s the last in the series and it really feels like I’m saying goodbye to Gabriel and his brothers. I was drawn into the story so completely that I felt like part of the world. I watched Gabriel grow as a character and was with him throughout his ups and downs, so it’s sad to say goodbye. In spite of this, all questions left after the first and second books were answered and all new twists and turns and revelations, of which there were many, were perfectly wrapped up to make a truly satisfying conclusion. 

Beverley Lee has single-handedly reignited my love for vampire-centred horror fiction, and if you want to be immersed in a world of terrifying, sexy, brooding vampires against the breathtaking Gothic backdrop of England, I can’t recommend the *Gabriel Davenport* series enough.
