If there is one old saying I don’t wish to live by it’s “ignorance is bliss”. In most cases, ignorance definitely *is not* bliss. Ignorance breeds all sorts of nasty behaviours and thoughts, many of which are touched on in this incredible anthology from *Burial Day* edited by *V. Castro and Cynthia (Cina) Pelayo*.  I’d rather educate myself and see the world from a perspective that is different to mine. There are many ways to go about this, but one of the best ways is reading, and this doesn’t have to be non-fiction books. 

I came to **Latinx Screams** for the horror fiction (and the amazing cover, let’s be honest), but left with a lot more than scares. I’m a little less culturally ignorant for having read these stories, written by a host of diverse, talented writers from various Latinx cultures. 

There is something for every horror lover in this anthology. You’ll find body horror, curses, demons, the devil, witchcraft, re-animation, folklore, the list goes on, but each of them are told in a different way from what you may be familiar with. This was exciting for me. I made several notes throughout so that I could read up on some of the legends and lore that come from Latinx cultures. 

The amazing authors not only wrote supernatural horror stories, though, they laced their stories with the real horrors that Latinx people face, sometimes on a daily basis. The stories were made that much scarier for this. You’ll glimpse the awful treatment of immigrant workers, steadfast religious relatives, racism, colourism, sexual abuse, grief, domestic violence, racial injustice, poverty, male dominance, and again, the list goes on. 

I was already familiar with a few of the writers, having read the charity anthology **[We Are Wolves](https://abitwordsy.blog/book-reviews/we-are-wolves/)**, which featured stories from *V. Castro* and *Cynthia Pelayo*. During the holiday season I also enjoyed *E. Reyes’* **[Christmas in The Empty Cabin and other Holiday Tales](https://abitwordsy.blog/book-reviews/christmas-in-the-empty-cabin/)** and *Sergio Gomez’s* **[The Visitor](https://abitwordsy.blog/book-reviews/the-visitor/)**, so I already had an inkling that I’d enjoy **Latinx Screams** too. I was correct and now I’ve been introduced to many more talented Latinx writers.  I recommend this anthology to everyone because, as I said, there is something in it for all of us and I believe we should all read more diversely.
