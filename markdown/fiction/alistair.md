The morning was particularly moody. Fierce, dark clouds blanketed the island threatening a downpour as Clare sat at her kitchen table flicking through the local newspaper. She sipped on a steaming mug of sweet, milky tea as the wind rattled the windows, and through the gloom outside she could see the sea dancing in the air as it crashed against the mossy rocks. 

She cupped both hands around her warm mug and sighed deeply. Days like these reminded her of days past. Days of love, warmth and motherhood, but one glance at the article on the page before her quickly jolted her back to reality. 

*Kate Jennings, 24, is desperately appealing to the public for any information that might help the police in their efforts to find her missing 3-year old son, Sean Jennings, allegedly abducted by his estranged father at around 2 a.m. on Sunday. Jennings was woken by the sound of her son crying and a commotion coming from downstairs. She claims that the boy’s father already had him in his arms as she ran down the stairs. He then threatened her before fleeing from the property. She screamed, pleaded and chased, but she was too late.*

Reading further, Clare learned that the young mother had no pictures of the father, that he didn’t even know their son existed as far as she knew. They were strangers that shared one night together under the influence of wine, and she hadn’t heard from him since. They never exchanged numbers, but she believed his first name to be Alistair, as she remembered the name was inscribed on the back of the pendent he wore around his neck that night. 

The article stated that Kate was beside herself and she reported that she worried for her son’s safety as the suspect appeared to be wearing very little clothing and drenched, as if he had been swimming in the sea. “He looked unhinged”, she agonised, “and he flashed a crazed, animal-like look my way. It was almost a grimace”. A warning, she thought, not to come after them. “The most frightening thing”, she recounted, “was his teeth. He appeared to have modified them or something. It was quite dark, but I know normal human teeth when I see them, and these were definitely not normal.”

Clare’s chest tightened. She stroked her thumb across the sketch of the abductor, a lump forming in her throat. Tears brimmed over her eyes and then she wept. Her heart ached for Kate Jennings because she knew that helpless young woman would never see her son again. It had been over 20 years since she herself became so immediately and hopelessly childless, and she felt in the pit of her stomach that this crazed, animal-like abductor the article described was her Alistair, the son ripped from her in almost an identical way all those years ago. 

Clare didn’t believe in coincidences. She had heard the stories many times- beings that walked the earth as beautiful humans, but their home was at sea- the seal-folk, but she dismissed them as nothing but old tales. Until that day she too watched a man she’d shared a seemingly meaningless night with snatch her son away. She had chased him right to the shore, but it was in vain. He turned vicious. He bared razor-like canines and snarled at her. Remembering, she caressed the stumps where her index and middle fingers had been savaged off when she reached for Alistair. Scars left behind to remind her every day of her failure and her loss. 

That night, just as she did every night, she went to the shore with renewed hope, and there he stood before her with a sleeping boy in his arms. His dark, wavy hair fell messily about his shoulders, just as her own did, and his cloudy, grey eyes locked with hers, both frightened and determined. Around his neck hung a chain with the celestial sun pendant she’d bought for him as a boy. She had no doubt then. 

Tears falling gently down her cheeks, trying to cathch her breath, she whispered his name advancing forward and, apprehensively, he let her. She caressed his cheek and he rested his face against her palm, covering her imperfect hand with his own. He closed his eyes, comforted by his mother’s touch, and then the waves crashed against the rocks and in a blink he was gone again, back to the sea with his son.
